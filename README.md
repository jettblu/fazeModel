# Faze Modeling

This is a quick and dirty repo for face recogniton. Developed models will be used in [FAZE ID](https://faze.kryptik.app/). Data analysis is done in Python and saved for web use with languages like Typescript.

In general, we are optimizing for speed, size, and a low false postive rate. A more polished version of this repo will be available soon.
